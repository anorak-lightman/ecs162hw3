Docker stuff works now
Authentication works except need to implement the redirect after sign in to the correct html page based on user type
Database queries work and now just need to connect them to frontend
To Do:
* Add templates for user/moderator/admin so they can have the correct functions on their pages
* Connect database to frontend so you can add comments/remove comments based on user type
* Make comments sidebar that loads correct comments for article
